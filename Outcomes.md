# Identify target browser hometask

## Outcomes

Based on the tusk results, I can conclude that the js file sizes are unchanged in the first 2 cases, i.e. when we set up the browser list via the .babelrc file or via modules, but in the case of extending the browser spectrum, the js file size increased, although slightly, in this case (most likely the changes are minor, as the code size is small).
